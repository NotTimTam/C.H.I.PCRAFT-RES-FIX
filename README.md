C.H.I.PCRAFT-RES-FIX

NTC made a port of MINECRAFT Raspberry Pie Edition to chip. They added a resolution changer to make it fit on PocketC.H.I.P's screen. And although you can install it on a normal chip (using a regular monitor/tv as display), the window for minecraft is small and all the buttons don't fit in it. This is a Kernal Hacked version of NTC's port that allows the game to run in a larger window on C.H.I.P. Just follow the instructions.txt file in the .zip (after extracting to //home/chip) to build and run MINECRAFT in minutes!

Thanks to NTC for the original port. And for the C.H.I.PCRAFT LOGO!

Also check out NTC's blog post on how to install their port: http://blog.nextthing.co/play-minecraft-on-your-c-h-i-p-pocketc-h-i-p/


P.S. I added the instructions.txt file to the main git, so you no longer have to unpack the .zip to read it!
