C.H.I.PCRAFT-RES-FIX

NTC has gone down the pooper, but that doesn't mean C.H.I.P has. If you are playing MC on a Pocket C.H.I.P follow the original tutorial which is now saved here: http://chip.jfpossibilities.com/gits/chipcraft.git/

However, if you are trying to do it on a desktop C.H.I.P you can continue using this repository.

Thanks! (note: any NTC links in this readme will not work)

NTC made a port of MINECRAFT Raspberry Pi Edition to chip. They added a resolution changer to make it fit on PocketC.H.I.P's screen. And although you can install it on a normal chip (using a regular monitor/tv as display), the window for minecraft is small and the gui doesn't fit properly on bigger screens. This is a modified version of NTC's port that allows the game to run in a larger window on C.H.I.P. Just follow the instructions.txt file in the .zip (after extracting to //home/chip) to build and run MINECRAFT in minutes!

Thanks to NTC for the original port, and the C.H.I.PCRAFT LOGO.

Check out my original post on the C.H.I.P forum: https://bbs.nextthing.co/t/minecraft-raspberry-pie-edition-c-h-i-pcraft-resolution-fix-for-normal-monitors/16283 

Also check out NTC's blog post on how to install their port: http://blog.nextthing.co/play-minecraft-on-your-c-h-i-p-pocketc-h-i-p/

P.S. I added the instructions.txt file to the main git, so you no longer have to unpack the .zip to read it!
