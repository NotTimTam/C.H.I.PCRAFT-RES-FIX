# C.H.I.PCRAFT-RES-FIX
NTC made a port of MINECRAFT Raspberry Pie Edition to chip. They added a resolution changer to make it fit on PocketC.H.I.P's screen. And although you can install it on a normal chip (using a regular monitor/tv as display), the window for minecraft is small and all the buttons don't fit in it. This is a Kernal Hacked version of NTC's port that allows the game to run in a larger window on C.H.I.P. Just follow the instructions.txt file in the zip (after extracting to //home/chip) to build and run MINECRAFT in minutes!

Thanks to NTC for the original port.
