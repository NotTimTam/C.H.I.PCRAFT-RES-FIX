Here is a fun thing to try, open MINECRAFT Raspberry Pie Edition on C.H.I.P twice! Then get a button mapper and connect a usb/bluetooth
controller to one window, and use a mouse and keyboard with the other. Then you can have a LAN game on the same system and play with a
friend! (by opening a world on one game, and joining it through the other!) (I guess it isn't really LAN then. But the computer still see's it that way.)
